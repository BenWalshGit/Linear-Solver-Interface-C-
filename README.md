## Linear Solver Interface in C++

This repository contains part of a group project involving the development of a Linear ALgebra Solver software.

The included code is a user interface, where the user can interact with the software, specifically to make choices for the type of problem they have, and the desired solution.

The user is asked:

- Whether they would like to manually input a matrix, or if they would prefer to use an input txt file.
- Which type of input matrix they would like to use (Sparse or Dense)
- The size of the matrix
- Which solver method to use (Cholesky or Jacobi)
- Within each solver method, there are different types of solvers

Feel free to browse the code to get a feel for the interface. Unfortunately, the full software is not available for viewingn due to other parts of the project being completed by other team members.
